/* Navigation means moving from one page to another
 While moving we have to write extra code but we won't have to while coming back
 Navigation is not limited to one page to another, we can also pass some data or some property during navigation
 All activities are same as home activity
 To Navigate from one activity to another activity in flutter, there's a property called navigator
 In navigator there's a property called push which we can call and this method will contain 2 parameter, context and route.
 Context parameter is inside build method by default. Route means destination. The route will be a function called materialpageroute, this will have builder property
 We will create anonymous function inside builder property. We will specify where/which activity we wanna go inside this anonymous function.
 Flutter will generate a back navigation by default.

//Data Navigation:
//First, massage will pass from homeactivity class and get into activity 1 class, here it will first get inside constructor and then we will find it inside a variable
//From that variable we are showing it in the tile of app bar
